🚀 Mad Scientist Mode: ON! 🤯


👾 Welcome to My Digital Lab – ManmathX
🎮 Hacker | AI Alchemist | Web Wizard | Chaos Creator

"Code like a beast, debug like a detective, ship like a ninja!"

🌌 I'm not just a developer—I'm an Architect of Madness, an AI Sorcerer, and a Pixel Pushing Machine crafting futuristic digital landscapes.

🔥 Who Am I?
⚡ A full-stack techno-mancer wielding code like an elemental force.
💡 A problem annihilator, breaking and rebuilding systems for maximum efficiency.
🚀 A speedster, automating workflows faster than your coffee brews.
🎭 A cyber-warrior, ready to tackle algorithms, bugs, and rogue AI.

🎭 Skills & Shenanigans
💻 Languages: Python, JavaScript, C++, MySQL, Rust (sometimes for fun!)
🛠️ Frameworks: React, Node.js, TensorFlow, PyTorch
🔧 Tools: Git, Docker, Postman, VS Code, Neovim (Yes, I like pain.)
☁️ Cloud Wizardry: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud (Clouds are just someone else’s computers.)

🤖 Currently Brewing in the Lab
🚀 Supercharged AI Models – Smarter, Faster, Unpredictable
🎨 Next-Level Web Experiences – React + Vue = 🤯
☁️ Cloud Automations – Because clicking buttons is boring
🕵️ Cybersecurity Research – Breaking into my own systems (legally 😈)

🛠️ Mad Experiments & Crazy Builds
🕹️ Built a game bot that solves Sudoku in under 10 seconds! (Might make it evil soon 🤖)
🎯 Created an AI assistant that roasts me if I write bad code. (Yes, it’s brutal.)
⚡ Optimized a database query so fast it scared my senior.
🔐 Once hacked my own system… just to see if I could. (Ethically, of course!)

🏆 Trophy Cabinet of Doom
🎖️ GitHub Trophies: Because flexing is necessary!
